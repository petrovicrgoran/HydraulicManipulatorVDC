# Mathematical modelling and virtual decomposition control of heavy-duty parallel-serial manipulators
The repository contains Simulink model and MATLAB code for the real-world hydraulic manipulator control, based on the approach proposed in the article:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2021.104680

# Requirements
The simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulink Simscape Multibody Add-On libraries are required and MATLAB version 2020a or newer.

# Usage
Make the main folder as a working folder and run 'RUN_ME.m' The 'RUN_ME.m' file is such that is allows the user to make easy changes to relevant parameters and investigate their influence to the simulated system behavior.

# Licence
